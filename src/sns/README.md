# Coralogix-SNS

This application retrieves **SNS** message and sends them to your **Coralogix** account.

It requires the following parameters:
* **ApplicationName** - A mandatory metadata field that is sent with each log and helps to classify it.
* **SNSTopicArn** - The ARN of SNS topic to subscribe.
* **CoralogixRegion** - Possible values are `Europe`, `Europe2`, `US`, `Singapore` or `India`. Choose `Europe` if your Coralogix account URL ends with `.com`, `US` if it ends with `.us` and `India` if it ends with `.in`. This is a **Coralogix** parameter and does not relate to your to your AWS region.
* **PrivateKey** - Can be found in your **Coralogix** account under `Settings` -> `Send your logs`. It is located in the upper left corner.
* **SubsystemName** - An mandatory metadata field that is sent with each log and helps to classify it.

Do not change the `FunctionMemorySize` and `FunctionTimeout` parameters. The application should be installed in the same AWS region as the CloudWatch log group.

**Note:** You can use log field as `Application/Subsystem` names. Just use following syntax: `$.my_log.field`.
