# AWS S3 integarion for Coralogix

Coralogix provides a predefined Lambda function to easily forward your S3 logs straight to the Coralogix platform.

## Prerequisites

* AWS account (Your AWS user should have permissions to create lambdas and IAM roles).
* Coralogix account.
* AWS S3 bucket.
* in case you use Secret Manager you should first deploy the [SM lambda layer](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/eu-central-1/597078901540/Coralogix-Lambda-SSMLayer), you should only deploy one layer per region.
