# AWS CloudWatch-logs integarion for Coralogix

Coralogix provides a predefined Lambda function to easily forward your CloudWatch logs straight to the Coralogix platform.

IF you want to use **AWS Secrets** to store the private_key, first you need to deploy Coralogix SecretLayer form AWS Serverless Repository.
Take in consideration that both layers and lambda need to be in the same AWS Region.

## Prerequisites

* AWS user with permissions to create lambdas and IAM roles.
* AWS Cloudwatch log group & log stream
* A Coralogix account.
* Optional - use ``SSM`` to add the Coralogix private key as a ``AWS secrets``. Deploy from ``AWS Serverless application repository`` the [Coralogix-Lambda-SSMLayer](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/eu-central-1/597078901540/Coralogix-Lambda-SSMLayer)

## Fields

| Parameter | Description | Default Value | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| Application name | The stack name of this application created via AWS CloudFormation. |   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| CoralogixRegion | The Coralogix location region, possible options are [Europe, Europe2, India, Singapore, US].In case that you want to use Custom domain, leave this as default and write the Custom doamin in the ``CustomDomain`` filed. |  Europe | :heavy_check_mark: | 
| CustomDomain | The Coralogix custom domain,leave empty if you don't use Custom domain. | |  | 
| ApiKey | Your Coralogix secret key. |   | :heavy_check_mark: | 
| ApplicationName | Application Name as it will be seen in Coralogix UI. |   | :heavy_check_mark: | 
| SubsystemName | Sybsystem Name as it will be seen in Coralogix UI. |   | :heavy_check_mark: | 
| CloudWatchLogGroupName | Has to contain one *log group* name from the set of log groups you would like to forward to **Coralogix**. If more than one groups is forwarded add each log group as a trigger to the Lambda being created by this application. |   | :heavy_check_mark: | 
| SsmEnabled | Set this to True to use AWS Secrets  (When enable it creates the secret in with the following pattern "lambda/coralogix/<AWS_REGION>/<Cloudwatch_lambda_name>"). The field receive 'True' or 'False'. **Note:** Both layers and lambda need to be in the same AWS Region.|  False | |
| LayerARN | This is the ARN of the Coralogix SecurityLayer. Copy from the ``SSM`` serverless application the ARN that was installed on the AWS account.| | |
| NotificationEmail | If the lambda fails a notification email will be sent to this address via SNS (requires you have a working SNS, with a validated domain).| | |
| NewlinePattern | Do not change! This is the pattern for lines splitting.| ``(?:\r\n\|\r\|\n)`` | |
| FunctionArchitecture | Lambda function architecture, possible options are [x86_64, arm64]| x86_64 | |
| FunctionMemorySize | The maximum allocated memory this lambda may consume. Don't change| 1024 | |
| FunctionTimeout | The maximum time in seconds the function may be allowed to run. Don't change| 300 | |
| SamplingRate | Send messages with specific rate| 1 | |
| BufferCharset | The charset to use for buffer decoding, possible options are [utf8, ascii]| utf8 | |
