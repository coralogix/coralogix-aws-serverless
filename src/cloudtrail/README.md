# AWS cloud trail integarion for Coralogix

Coralogix provides a seamless integration with ``AWS`` cloud so you can send your logs from anywhere and parse them according to your needs.

This application retrieves cloudtrail logs from s3 and sends them to your Coralogix account.

IF you want to use AWS Secrets to store the private_key, first you need to deploy Coralogix SecretLayer form AWS Serverless Repository. Take in consideration that both layers and lambda need to be in the same AWS Region.

## Prerequisites

* An AWS account.
* An coralogix account.
