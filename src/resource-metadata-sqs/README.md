# Coralogix Resource Metadata (SQS mode)

This application collect AWS resource metadata and sends them to your **Coralogix** account.

This is a specific version of the [resource-metadata](../resource-metadata) application, which is designed to:

1. Handle huge amount of Lambda functions in the target AWS Region (5000+).
2. Support cross-account and multi-region collection of metadata from multiple AWS accounts.

## Prerequisites

* Permissions to create required AWS resources (Lambda, SQS, SNS, Cloudtrail etc.)
* An AWS account.
* A coralogix account.
* in case you use Secret Manager you should first deploy the [SM lambda layer](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/eu-central-1/597078901540/Coralogix-Lambda-SSMLayer), you should only deploy one layer per region.
* in case you want to collect metadata from multiple AWS accounts, you need to create the IAM roles in the target accounts (see [Cross-Account Collection](#cross-account-collection) for more details).

| NotificationEmail | If the lambda fails a notification email will be sent to this address via SNS (requires you have a working SNS, with a validated domain). | | |

| MaximumConcurrency | Maximum number of concurrent SQS messages to be processed by `generator` lambda after the collection has finished. | 5 | |


## Cross-Account Collection

This function supports cross-account collection of metadata from multiple AWS accounts. To enable this feature, you need to specify the `CrossAccountIAMRoleArns` parameter with the IAM role ARNs of the accounts you want to collect metadata from. Here is the set of required IAM permissions that should be set on the target roles:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
            "ec2:DescribeInstances",
            "lambda:ListFunctions",
            "lambda:ListVersionsByFunction", 
            "lambda:GetFunction",
            "lambda:ListAliases",
            "lambda:ListEventSourceMappings",
            "lambda:GetPolicy",
            "tag:GetResources"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```


As you will know the exact functions' role ARNs only after the template is deployed, you need to follow these steps to make it work:

1. Create the roles in the target accounts, setting necessary IAM permissions, but without setting the trust relationship to the source account, since we don't know Lambda functions role ARNs yet.
2. Deploy the template with the `CrossAccountIAMRoleArns` parameter, mentioning the target roles' ARNs.
3. After the template is deployed, set the trust relationship to the source account, using the Lambda functions' role ARNs. Make sure to include both `collector` and `generator` functions' role ARNs. Here is an example of a trust relationship policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/mystackname-GeneratorLambdaFunctionRole-randomid",
                    "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/mystackname-CollectorLambdaFunctionRole-randomid"
                ]
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```

After setting the trust relationship, the `generator` and `collector` functions will be able to assume the target roles and collect metadata from those accounts.

## Notes

1. Both layers and lambda need to be in the same AWS Region.
2. The `Schedule` parameter needs to be longer than the time it takes to collect the metadata. For example, if it takes 10 minutes to collect the metadata from all lambda functions, the `Schedule` parameter should be set to `rate(15 minutes)` at least.
3. The `ResourceTtlMinutes` parameter needs to be longer than the `Schedule` parameter. For example, if the `Schedule` parameter is set to `rate(15 minutes)`, the `ResourceTtlMinutes` parameter should be set to at least 20 minutes.
